# The Syntax Hilighter
**This is a work still in progress.** It is suppoed to support syntax highlighting for programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, Bash, Awk, and more. In one word, it will support whichever language I am and will be learning.

# Motivation
The hilighter will be used in Anki only. It may serve as a prototype for other future projects, though.

Given the popular `highligh.js` and `pygments` projects, why do I need to re-invent the wheel?

Well, it is simply because the two above are too big tools to meet my small need. I just need a flexible, lightweight, self-contatined syntax highlighter that works well with Anki.

First I was thinking about using Python, in which the whole software has been written and developed. Yet later I changed my mind because such work remains too complicated for me at the moment. So I turned to JavaScript instead.
