# What
This repo holds the scripts that will automate the workflow, hence reducing the workload, of my friend Jessie, so that she will seemiingly earn more. 

There are two directories: `anki` and `bash`. As the names themselves indicate, `anki` dir is all about the popular memorization software [Anki](). Most of the scripts here will be written in Python.

The `bash` dir contains all the `.sh` scripts that can automate some boring and time-consuming tasks commonly met on a click-and-point Desktop Environment.

## The `anki` dir 
Hopefully, the scripts might eventually evolve into an anki add-on. 

## The `bash` dir
The scripts there also serve as learning materials since both of us are new to bash programming.
