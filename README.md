# What
This repo holds the scripts that will automate some tedious routines and reduce the workload for my friend Jessie, so that she will _seemiingly_ earn more. 

There are two directories: `anki` and `bash`. 

## The `anki` dir 
As the names itself indicates, the `anki` dir is all about the popular memorization software [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Most of the scripts here will be written in Python. Hopefully, the scripts might eventually evolve into an anki add-on. 

## The `bash` dir
The `bash` dir contains all the `.sh` scripts that can automate some boring and time-consuming tasks commonly met on a point-and-click Desktop Environment. These scripts also serve as learning experiments since both of us are new to bash programming.  

## The `highlighters` dir
This directory contains syntax highlighters for various programming languages. They are, however, not the dynamic highlighters which work like a parser. Instead, they are written in JavaScript and rely solely on the `.replace()` method to statically match and replace the lexes.  

## The `gsuite` dir
Some Google Apps Scripts useful for my daily work.
There will also be a web app.
